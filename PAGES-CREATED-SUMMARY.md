### Main Navigation Pages

## 🎯 How These Pages Work

### CMS-Driven Content

All pages follow the same pattern:

```typescript
// 1. Fetch page from Sanity by slug
const page = await fetchSanityPageBySlug({ slug: 'about' });

// 2. If page doesn't exist, show friendly message
if (!page) {
  return MissingSanityPage({ document: 'page', slug: 'about' });
}

// 3. Render blocks from Sanity
return <Blocks blocks={page?.blocks ?? []} />;
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Content managed in Sanity Studio
- ✅ No code changes needed for content updates
- ✅ Block-based flexible layouts
- ✅ SEO metadata controlled in Sanity
- ✅ ISR caching for performance

## ⚠️ Important: Next Steps Required

### These pages exist in CODE but NOT in Sanity yet!

You need to create matching page documents in Sanity Studio:

1. **Visit Sanity Studio:** http://localhost:3333
2. **Go to "Page" section**
3. **Create a new page for each:**
   - about
   - contact
   - services
   - locations
   - privacy-policy
   - terms-of-service

4. **For each page:**
   - Set the **slug** to match (e.g., `about`)
   - Add a **meta title** and **meta description**
   - Add **blocks** (hero, sections, CTAs, etc.)
   - Click **Publish**

### Until you create these in Sanity:

When you visit the URL, you'll see:
```
⚠️ This page is missing from Sanity

Create a page document with slug: "about"
```

This is **intentional** - it tells you to create the content in Sanity.

## 🔗 Setting Up Navigation

See the complete guide: **[NAVIGATION-SETUP-GUIDE.md](NAVIGATION-SETUP-GUIDE.md)**

### Quick Navigation Setup

1. Go to Sanity Studio → **Navigation**
2. Add links for each page:
   - Home → Internal Link → page (index)
   - About → Internal Link → page (about)
   - Services → Internal Link → page (services)
   - Locations → Internal Link → page (locations)
   - Contact → Internal Link → page (contact)

3. Optionally add dropdowns:
   - Services can have sub-links to individual services
   - Locations can have sub-links to individual locations

4. Publish and wait 60 seconds for ISR

## ✅ Testing Your Pages

### Test in Browser

Visit each URL to verify they work:

```bash
# Start dev server if not running
pnpm dev
```

Then visit:
- http://localhost:3000/about
- http://localhost:3000/contact
- http://localhost:3000/services
- http://localhost:3000/locations
- http://localhost:3000/privacy-policy
- http://localhost:3000/terms-of-service

**Expected Result:**
- ⚠️ Shows "Missing from Sanity" message (until you create pages in Studio)
- ✅ No 404 errors
- ✅ Page structure loads

### After Creating in Sanity

Once you create the pages in Sanity:
- ✅ Content appears
- ✅ SEO metadata works
- ✅ Blocks render correctly

---

## 🚀 Production Readiness

### Code Level
✅ **Complete** - All routes are properly configured

### Content Level
⏳ **Pending** - Needs content in Sanity Studio

### Navigation Level
⏳ **Pending** - Needs navigation setup in Sanity

### Estimated Time to Complete
- Create pages in Sanity: **30 minutes**
- Add content to each page: **2-3 hours**
- Configure navigation: **15 minutes**
- Test everything: **30 minutes**

**Total:** ~4 hours to fully populate and test

## 📝 Notes

### Why This Approach?

1. **Explicit Routes** - Avoids routing conflicts with Phase 1 pattern
2. **CMS-Driven** - All content managed in Sanity
3. **Flexible** - Use any blocks on any page
4. **SEO-Friendly** - Each page has proper metadata
5. **Scalable** - Easy to add more pages

### Alternative Approach

If you want many generic pages, you can:
1. Create `/pages/[slug]` route (see ROUTING-STRATEGY.md)
2. Set up redirects from `/about` → `/pages/about`

But explicit routes are cleaner and avoid confusion.

---
