## Schema UI Starter: MANDATORY Component Patterns

**CRITICAL**: Schema UI uses a composable block architecture. You MUST follow these patterns.

### Component Structure

- ✅ Each block schema type has a corresponding React component
- ✅ Blocks are organized hierarchically: parent blocks (like `split-row`, `grid-row`) contain child components
- ✅ Component files mirror schema structure (e.g., `components/blocks/split/split-row.tsx` matches `schemas/blocks/split/split-row.ts`)

### Dynamic Component Mapping Pattern

Parent block components **MUST** use a `componentMap` object for type-safe dynamic rendering:

```typescript
// Example: components/blocks/split/split-row.tsx
import { stegaClean } from "next-sanity";
import { PAGE_QUERYResult } from "@/sanity.types";
import SectionContainer from "@/components/blocks/section-container";
import SplitContent from "./split-content";
import SplitImage from "./split-image";

type Block = NonNullable<NonNullable<PAGE_QUERYResult>["blocks"]>[number];
type SplitRow = Extract<Block, { _type: "split-row" }>;
type SplitColumn = NonNullable<NonNullable<SplitRow["splitColumns"]>[number]>;

// Type-safe componentMap
const componentMap: {
  [K in SplitColumn["_type"]]: React.ComponentType<
    Extract<SplitColumn, { _type: K }>
  >;
} = {
  "split-content": SplitContent,
  "split-image": SplitImage,
};

export default function SplitRow({
  padding,
  colorVariant,
  splitColumns,
}: SplitRow) {
  const color = stegaClean(colorVariant);

  return (
    <SectionContainer color={color} padding={padding}>
      {splitColumns && splitColumns.length > 0 && (
        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
          {splitColumns.map((column) => {
            const Component = componentMap[column._type];
            if (!Component) {
              console.warn(
                `No component implemented for type: ${column._type}`
              );
              return <div data-type={column._type} key={column._key} />;
            }

            // TypeScript limitation: dynamic lookup breaks discriminated union narrowing
            // This is one of ONLY acceptable any usages in the codebase
            // Safe: componentMap guarantees Component type matches column._type at runtime
            // Alternative: Cast to specific type if known
            return (
              <Component
                {...(column as Extract<SplitColumn, { _type: typeof column._type }>)}
                color={color}
                key={column._key}
              />
            );
          })}
        </div>
      )}
    </SectionContainer>
  );
}
```

### TypeScript Type Extraction Rules

**CRITICAL**: Follow TypeScript Standards Enforcer for detailed rules (`.claude/typescript-standards-enforcer.md`).

- ✅ **ALWAYS** extract types from Sanity query results using TypeScript utilities
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use `Extract<>` to narrow union types for specific block types
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use `NonNullable<>` to unwrap optional arrays
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use `[number]` to extract array item types
- ✅ **ALWAYS** type the componentMap with mapped types for type safety
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use `stegaClean` from `next-sanity` to clean Sanity values
- ✅ **NEVER** use `any` type (see Emergency Violations below for ONLY exception)
- ✅ **NEVER** use `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-expect-error` without documented justification

**Type Extraction Pattern**:

```typescript
// Extract block type from query result
type Block = NonNullable<NonNullable<PAGE_QUERYResult>['blocks']>[number];
type SplitRow = Extract<Block, { _type: 'split-row' }>;

// Extract array item type
type SplitColumn = NonNullable<NonNullable<SplitRow['splitColumns']>[number]>;

// Extract specific variant from union
type Hero1Block = Extract<Block, { _type: 'hero-1' }>;
```

**Null vs Undefined Handling**:

```typescript
// Sanity returns | null, Next.js APIs expect | undefined
// Use null coalescing at API boundaries

// ✅ CORRECT - generateMetadata
export async function generateMetadata({ params }): Promise<Metadata> {
  const service = await client.fetch(SERVICE_QUERY, {
    slug: params.serviceSlug,
  });
  if (!service) return {};

  return {
    title: service.meta_title || service.name || 'Service', // Coalesce null
    description: service.meta_description || '',
    openGraph: service.ogImage
      ? {
          title: service.meta_title || service.name || 'Service',
          description: service.meta_description || '',
        }
      : undefined, // Use undefined for optional objects
  };
}

// ❌ WRONG - Don't pass null to Next.js APIs
return {
  title: service.meta_title, // Error: Type 'string | null' not assignable to 'string | undefined'
};
```

### Component Implementation Rules

- ✅ Create a React component for each schema type
- ✅ Use TypeScript to ensure type safety between schema and component
- ✅ Implement componentMap for dynamic child rendering in parent blocks
- ✅ Handle missing components gracefully with console warnings
- ✅ Pass `_key` from Sanity as React `key` prop

### Warning Pattern

If a block type is registered in schema but not implemented in componentMap:

```typescript
if (!Component) {
  console.warn(`No component implemented for type: ${block._type}`);
  return <div data-type={block._type} key={block._key} />;
}
```

## Ownership and Handoffs

- Consume data from Sanity CMS through typed Sanity queries. Use generated types from `sanity.types`
- All component props are typed from Sanity query results
- Use `stegaClean` to sanitize values from Sanity before using them
- Emit UI events and typed actions only. No shared global state by default
- Document component patterns in code comments

## Default Tech Choices

- React 18 with Next.js App Router. TypeScript strict.
- Styling: Tailwind. CSS Modules for edge cases. Design tokens for themes.
- State: Server Components first. TanStack Query for server data on the client. Zustand for local UI state.
- Forms: React Hook Form + Zod.
- Charts: Recharts. Animations: Framer Motion only when needed.
- Images: next/image. Icons: lucide-react.
- Testing: Vitest or Jest for unit. Playwright for E2E. Axe for a11y.
- Docs: Storybook with Controls and Docs.

## Standards and Gates

### Accessibility (WCAG AA)

- Keyboard first. Visible focus on all controls.
- Semantic HTML. Use native elements before ARIA.
- Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1. Text never baked into images.
- Forms have labels, descriptions, and error summaries. Use aria-live for async errors.
- Motion settings respect prefers-reduced-motion.
- CI runs axe. Fail on violations.

### Security

- Content Security Policy with nonce. No inline scripts.
- Escape user content. Sanitize any HTML before dangerouslySetInnerHTML.
- Block mixed content. Use HTTPS links.
- Dependency audit on CI. Fail on high severity.
- Do not leak secrets in client bundles.

### Internationalization

- Locale routing. All strings externalized. No hardcoded copy.
- Number, date, and currency formatting per locale.
- RTL support where required.
- Language switch accessible by keyboard and screen readers.

### Performance

- Route JS budget < 200 KB gz on mobile. CLS < 0.1. LCP < 2.5 s on 4G. TTI < 3.9 s.
- Use Server Components by default. Split code by route and feature.
- Use dynamic import for heavy modules. Preload critical fonts. font-display: swap.
- Use next/image and image CDNs. Avoid layout shift. Reserve space for media.
- Cache and memoize. Avoid render waterfalls. Measure re-render counts.

### Testing

- Unit tests for logic and component contracts.
- Storybook stories for each component state.
- E2E tests for core flows. Include mobile viewports.
- Visual regression checks on key pages.
- Lighthouse CI thresholds per PR. Fail on regressions.

### Observability

- Report Web Vitals. Track LCP, CLS, INP, FID.
- Error tracking with source maps. Use Sentry or similar.
- Feature flags for risky changes. Add kill switches.

### Release and CI

- Preview deployments on every PR.
- CI runs lint, typecheck, unit, E2E, axe, visual, Lighthouse, bundle-size checks.
- Block merges on CI failures.
- Semver for component library. Changelog required.

## Next.js Rules

- Server Components by default. Use Client Components when you need state, refs, or effects.
- Use Route Handlers for server APIs. Prefer streaming for long tasks.
- Use Metadata API for SEO and social tags.
- Use app router conventions for layouts, templates, and error boundaries.
- Keep environment variables on the server side. Never expose secrets.

## Data Layer

- Fetch on the server during render when possible.
- For client caches, use TanStack Query. Set cacheTime, staleTime, and retry policy.
- Stable cache keys. Invalidate on mutations.
- Skeletons for loading. Strong empty states. Clear error states with retry.

## Design System

- Composition over inheritance. Use slots. Avoid prop explosion.
- Name props clearly. Avoid booleans that toggle many styles.
- Theming with tokens. Dark mode and high contrast themes.
- Document usage and constraints in Storybook.
- Deprecation policy. Mark old APIs and provide migration notes.

## Forms

- Validate on client and server. Trust server truth.
- Show inline errors and a summary. Keep focus on the first error.
- Protect against CSRF on mutations. Limit upload size and type.
- Use accessible controls. Do not hide labels. Provide help text.

## Edge and Runtime

- Define which routes run at the Edge.
- Do not use Node-only APIs at the Edge.
- Keep secrets on the server. Use Server Actions with care.

## Acceptance Criteria

- No console errors or warnings.
- All flows keyboard accessible.
- Axe passes in CI. WCAG AA met.
- CWV budgets met on mobile.
- All new components have stories and tests.
- No unhandled promise rejections.
- Bundle-size delta within budget.
- Error boundaries present for routes and critical widgets.

- Accessibility 20
- Performance 20
- Testing and CI 20
- Security 15
- Internationalization 10
- Architecture and data layer 15

## Next.js Dynamic Routing — Project Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Follow these patterns for service, location, and service-location pages.

### Route Structure

1. **Service Pages**: `/app/(main)/services/[serviceSlug]/page.tsx`
2. **Location Pages**: `/app/(main)/locations/[locationSlug]/page.tsx`
3. **Service-Location Pages**: `/app/(main)/services/[serviceSlug]/in/[locationSlug]/page.tsx`

### Dynamic Route Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Example: /app/(main)/services/[serviceSlug]/page.tsx
import { notFound } from "next/navigation";
import { client } from "@/sanity/client";
import { SERVICE_QUERY, SERVICES_SLUGS_QUERY } from "@/sanity/queries/service";
import type { Metadata } from "next";

// Generate static params for all services
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const services = await client.fetch(SERVICES_SLUGS_QUERY);
  return services.map((service) => ({
    serviceSlug: service.slug,
  }));
}

// Generate metadata for SEO
export async function generateMetadata({ params }): Promise<Metadata> {
  const service = await client.fetch(SERVICE_QUERY, {
    slug: params.serviceSlug,
  });

  if (!service) return {};

  return {
    title: service.seo?.meta_title || service.name,
    description: service.seo?.meta_description || service.headline,
    // ... other metadata
  };
}

// Page component
export default async function ServicePage({ params }) {
  const service = await client.fetch(SERVICE_QUERY, {
    slug: params.serviceSlug,
  });

  if (!service) notFound();

  return (
    <>
      {/* Render sections using SectionRenderer */}
      {/* Add JSON-LD structured data */}
    </>
  );
}
```

### Fallback Logic for Service-Location Pages

When a service-location page is missing optional fields, fallback to service defaults:

```typescript
const headline = serviceLocation.headline || service.headline;
const introCopy = serviceLocation.introCopy || service.introCopy;
const sections =
  serviceLocation.sections?.length > 0
    ? serviceLocation.sections
    : service.sections;
const testimonials =
  serviceLocation.localTestimonials?.length > 0
    ? serviceLocation.localTestimonials
    : service.testimonials;
```

### SEO Requirements

- ✅ Every page must implement `generateMetadata`
- ✅ Include LocalBusiness JSON-LD for all service pages
- ✅ Include FAQ JSON-LD if FAQs exist
- ✅ Include Breadcrumb JSON-LD for navigation
- ✅ Respect `noindex` boolean from seo object
- ✅ Generate canonical URLs
- ✅ Use `/lib/seo.ts` utility functions

### Static Site Generation Rules

- ✅ Use `generateStaticParams` to pre-render all routes
- ✅ Use ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for content updates
- ✅ Handle 404s with `notFound()` from `next/navigation`
- ✅ All routes must pass `npm run build` successfully

---

## Project-Specific Requirements: Budds Plumbing Platform

### Required Routes

1. Service pages: `/services/[serviceSlug]`
2. Location pages: `/locations/[locationSlug]`
3. Service-Location pages: `/services/[serviceSlug]/in/[locationSlug]`

### Required Components

- `SectionRenderer` (central renderer that loops sections[] and renders by \_type)
- Service page layout components
- Location page layout components
- Service-Location page layout components with fallback logic

### Roadmap Compliance

- ✅ Follow Budds Plumbing Roadmap v3 strictly (20 tasks, sequential)
- ✅ **NO TASK MAY BEGIN UNTIL PREVIOUS TASK IS COMPLETE**
- ✅ Definition of Complete: Code merged to main, lint passes, typecheck passes, build passes, QA verified
- ✅ After route implementation: test with `npm run build` and verify all routes generate

## Emergency Violations Detection

If you detect ANY of these violations, **STOP IMMEDIATELY** and refuse to proceed:

### Architecture Violations

❌ Creating components without componentMap pattern for parent blocks
❌ Not using stegaClean for Sanity values
❌ Not extracting types from Sanity query results
❌ Hardcoding content instead of using Sanity data
❌ Missing generateStaticParams for dynamic routes
❌ Missing generateMetadata for SEO
❌ Not handling 404s with notFound()
❌ Not implementing fallback logic for service-location pages
❌ Starting a new task before previous task is complete
❌ Skipping build checks before marking task complete

### TypeScript Violations (ZERO TOLERANCE)

❌ Using `any` type anywhere (except documented single case in `components/blocks/index.tsx`)
❌ Using `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-expect-error` without full justification
❌ Not running `pnpm typecheck` before completing task
❌ Passing Sanity `| null` types to Next.js APIs (must coalesce to `| undefined`)
❌ Accessing properties not projected in GROQ queries
❌ Using wrong property on Sanity references (\_id vs \_ref)
❌ Not using Extract<>, NonNullable<>, [number] for type narrowing
❌ Creating test data that doesn't match schema types
❌ Ignoring TypeScript errors instead of fixing root cause
❌ Using type assertions (`as`) without documented justification

**MANDATORY VALIDATION BEFORE TASK COMPLETION**:

```bash
# All must pass with zero errors/warnings
pnpm typecheck  # 0 errors
pnpm lint       # 0 warnings
pnpm build      # successful build
```

**Your job is to enforce these patterns with ABSOLUTE STRICTNESS.**

See `.claude/typescript-standards-enforcer.md` for comprehensive TypeScript rules and patterns.
