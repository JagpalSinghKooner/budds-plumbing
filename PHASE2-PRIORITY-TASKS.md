# Phase 2 - Priority Tasks (Admin Dashboard Deferred)

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Focus:** Core Multi-Tenant Features Only
**Deferred:** Admin Dashboard (End of Project)

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED & PRODUCTION READY

### Core Multi-Tenant Infrastructure
1. ‚úÖ Client Configuration Schema (Sanity)
2. ‚úÖ Dataset Routing Middleware
3. ‚úÖ Multi-Domain Infrastructure
4. ‚úÖ Client Provisioning Automation
5. ‚úÖ Routing Strategy (Phase 1 preserved)
6. ‚úÖ Documentation (3,000+ lines)

**All fixes are permanent - no patches or workarounds!**

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (In Order)

### 1. Test Multi-Tenant Features (2-3 hours)

**Goal:** Verify everything works end-to-end

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create a test client using provisioning script
- [ ] Verify dataset created in Sanity
- [ ] Add test domain to `domain-mapping.ts`
- [ ] Test domain routing locally (hosts file)
- [ ] Create content in test client's dataset
- [ ] Verify content appears on test client's site
- [ ] Test dataset isolation (no data leakage)

**Commands:**
```bash
# Create test client
pnpm run provision:create

# Validate
pnpm run provision:validate client-test
```

---

### 2. Production Domain Setup (1-2 hours)

**Goal:** Configure real domains for multi-tenant support

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add production domains to `domain-mapping.ts`
- [ ] Configure Vercel domain settings
- [ ] Set up DNS records for subdomains
- [ ] Test domain routing in staging
- [ ] Verify SSL certificates
- [ ] Test www redirects

**Example domains:**
- Main: `buddsplumbing.com`
- Client 1: `client1.buddsplumbing.com`
- Custom: `clientdomain.com`

---

### 3. Create Essential Pages (3-4 hours)

**Goal:** Add About, Contact, and other core pages

**Current Issue:** Generic `[slug]` route was removed to fix conflicts

**Solution:** Create explicit route folders

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `/about` page
- [ ] Create `/contact` page
- [ ] Create `/privacy-policy` page
- [ ] Create `/terms-of-service` page
- [ ] Update navigation links
- [ ] Test all pages load correctly

**Example:**
```bash
# Create folders
mkdir -p apps/web/app/(main)/about
mkdir -p apps/web/app/(main)/contact

# Create page.tsx in each folder
```

---

### 4. Content Migration (If Needed) (2-4 hours)

**Goal:** Move existing content to new structure

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Identify existing pages that need migration
- [ ] Export content from old structure
- [ ] Import into blocks-based structure
- [ ] Verify all content displays correctly
- [ ] Update internal links
- [ ] Set up redirects for old URLs

---

### 5. Multi-Client Testing (2-3 hours)

**Goal:** Test with multiple clients simultaneously

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create 3 test clients with provisioning script
- [ ] Configure unique domains for each
- [ ] Create different content per client
- [ ] Test concurrent access
- [ ] Verify complete dataset isolation
- [ ] Test performance with multiple clients
- [ ] Monitor Sanity API usage

---

### 6. Performance Optimization (2-3 hours)

**Goal:** Ensure fast load times across all clients

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Enable ISR for all dynamic routes
- [ ] Configure CDN caching
- [ ] Optimize images (already using next/image)
- [ ] Test Lighthouse scores per client
- [ ] Monitor bundle sizes
- [ ] Set up revalidation strategies

---

## üìã OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS

### Enhanced Provisioning (Optional)
- [ ] Add more template presets (HVAC, Roofing, etc.)
- [ ] Customize templates per industry
- [ ] Add logo upload during provisioning
- [ ] Pre-configure brand colors

### Advanced Routing (Optional)
- [ ] Implement `/pages/[slug]` for CMS-driven generic pages
- [ ] Add automatic redirects from old URLs
- [ ] Create 404 page per client
- [ ] Add sitemap per client

### Monitoring (Optional)
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Add analytics per client
- [ ] Create uptime monitoring
- [ ] Set up cost alerts

---

## ‚è∏Ô∏è DEFERRED TO END OF PROJECT

### Admin Dashboard
- Client management UI
- Database integration
- Authentication (Clerk)
- Form validation
- Metrics dashboard
- Activity logs

**Reason for Deferral:** Not needed for core multi-tenant functionality. Can be added once main site is complete and tested.

**Current Status:** Fully scaffolded and documented, ready to implement when needed.

{
  domain: "client1.buddsplumbing.com",
  projectId: DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID,
  dataset: "client1-production",
  clientId: "client1",
  enabled: true,
  branding: { name: "Client 1 Name" },
}
```

### Create New Page
```bash
mkdir -p apps/web/app/(main)/page-name

```

### Test Locally
```bash
# Edit /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 client1.buddsplumbing.local

## üéØ RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

**Right now, you should:**

1. **Test the provisioning system** (30 min)
   - Create a test client
   - Verify it works end-to-end

2. **Create essential pages** (2 hours)
   - About, Contact, Privacy Policy, Terms
   - Update navigation

3. **Test multi-domain locally** (1 hour)
   - Add test domains to hosts file
   - Verify routing works

4. **Deploy to staging** (1 hour)
   - Test in production-like environment
   - Verify everything works

**After that's solid, then:**
- Deploy to production
- Onboard first real client
- Monitor and iterate

---

**Focus:** Get core multi-tenant platform working perfectly first, then add admin features at the end.
